# Omnifood. Website for delivering food!

**HTML** & **CSS** oriented project. Introduced me to design and let me build design and creative skillset. Main focus is put on **aesthetics** and **beauty** but **not functionality**.

## How to use

* To **see all effects** and **animations** simply *scroll down* to the footer. 

* Check zooming effect of "dish pictures".

* *Navigation links* allow you to **travel across the webpage**. 

* This website has a **responsive web-design**. Feel free to check out its *mobile* and *tablet versions*.

## How to start

Need **final version**? Simply check link of the app. It is *in the header* next to the *description*. 

## Project structure

* **/index.html** is main HTML file. 

* **/vendors/** includes all **CSS** and **HTML code** *borrowed from other users* of the web.

* **/resources/** includes all **CSS** and **HTML code** created specifically for this project.


## Things I've learned 

* **HTML** & **CSS** **basics**. 

  * How to build **markup elements** such as *div*, *row* etc. 
  
  * How to assign **characteristics distinctive to each element** using *class*, *id*, *section* and other selectors. 

* **Webpage structure**. Such as the *header*, *footer*, *navigation links*, *sections* etc.

* **Steal like an artist!**

* **Design basics**. such as: *flat design*, *typography guidelines* and *color guidelines*.

* How to implement **responsive web-design** using *media queries*. Website looks neat and user-friendly on all types of devices.

* How to **create animations** and develop simple **AJAX applications** using *jQuery*.

* Real world 7-step rule for building a website:

  * **Define the goal of your project.** - Show what Omnifood does, how it works and in which cities it operates in. Make people sign up on a subscription plan. Audience: busy people who don’t have time to cook or don’t like it.
  
  * **Plan your content: text, images, videos, icons, etc.** - One-page webpage containing information provided by Omnifood, with simple navigation. Content and navigation both are provided in text document.
  
  * **Sketch your ideas before you design.** - One-page webpage containing information provided by Omnifood, with simple navigation. Content and navigation both are provided in text document.
  
  * **Design and develop your website.** - Color: orange. Font: LATO typeface.
  
  * **It’s not done yet: optimization.** - multiple jQuery plugins were used here. 
  
  * **Launch your masterpiece.** - Omnifood was launched on the Netlify server and link is provided next to the desroption tag.
  
  * **Site maintenance.** - due to little promotion website requires little maintenance. 
  
 * How to **borrow other people's stylesheets** and **font files** to achieve desired design solutions.
